# ðŸš— Car Production Line Optimization

This repository contains C++ implementations to optimize the production line scheduling of a car manufacturer, minimizing penalties associated with installing optional features (e.g., sunroofs, GPS) across consecutive cars. The project explores **exhaustive search**, **greedy algorithms**, and **metaheuristics** to solve this constrained sequencing problem.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Context

Developed as part of the *Algorithmics and Programming III* course at the **Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya (UPC)**, this project addresses a real-world production challenge: ordering cars with diverse feature requirements to avoid penalties from exceeding station capacity constraints (`c_e` cars per `n_e` consecutive cars).
