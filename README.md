# ðŸš— Car Production Line Optimization

This repository contains C++ implementations to optimize the production line scheduling of a car manufacturer, minimizing penalties associated with installing optional features (e.g., sunroofs, GPS) across consecutive cars. The project explores **exhaustive search**, **greedy algorithms**, and **metaheuristics** to solve this constrained sequencing problem.
